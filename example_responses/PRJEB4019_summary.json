Site discovery and genotyping for SNPs are based on both low coverage and exome capture sequence data for short indels, only low coverage data, and for large deletions, only the 946 individuals with Illumina low coverage sequence data are used.  As a final step, statistical genotype imputation using the linkage disequilibrium between nearby sites refines the individual genotypes and merges information from all three variant types.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing, Exome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS, ES","assembly":"GRCh37","platform":"Illumina Genome Analyzer, Illumina Genome Analyzer II, AB SOLiD System 2.0, AB SOLiD System, 454 GS FLX","url":"http://www.1000genomes.org/","publications":["20981092","23128226"],"numVariants":79435110,"numSamples":1092,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
